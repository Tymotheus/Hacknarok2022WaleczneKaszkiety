# Hacknarok 2022
The following repository is the result of the work for the Hacknarok 2022 Hackathon,
that took place on 2-3.04.2022. Members of the team **Waleczne Kaszkiety**:
Tymoteusz Ciesielski, Robert Kozik and Kamil Szczepanek joined their forces to face the common problem.
The subject was "New Reality". As a result, Citizenly app was conceived.

# Citizenly
## Inspiration
In todays reality, constructive feedback is gold: University sureveys, Society polls, Google reviews, Peer reviews in work.
Those are just some of the examples. Naturally there emerges need some sort of Centralized Platform for the Feedback Aggregation,
or how we call it in a more sexy way - Citizenly.

## What it does
Mobile app contains the database of the institutions such as Krakow Technology Park,
Faculty of Physics AGH University or a petrol station that you visit every week.
The app allows the users of those institutions to add two sorts of tickets:
1. Proposals for the local initiatives such as establishing an outdoor gym on the unused square in front of the company,
or organising more plants in a hall.
2. Proposals for the fixing of already-present solutions such as replacing the common bins in KTP with the recycle bins,
or repairing a hairdyer in the bathroom on the 1st floor.

Next, the managers of those institutions can take action and delegate the tickets for the realization-
having in mind the comfort of the users (and the potential profit!). 
The platform also contains a web app panel for those managers, with all the tickets,
providing the eye-pleasant statistics and graphics with numbers of votes given for the certain initiatives.

## How we built it
**Backend**: Django + DRF
**Frontend**: React for the web app + React-native for the mobile app

## What's next for the Citizenly
Deployment! As well as introducing some prompt for the users to use the app - maybe the point system for the users, allowing them to win some prizes.
For the managers some quality certificates could be issued.
